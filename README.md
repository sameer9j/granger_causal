# Granger Causality Detection on Stock Market Data using Deep Learning

Purpose: To create a interpretable deep neural network, which detects the granger causality between different stocks. To achieve this, using a sparse componentwise MLP, and LSTM with n-norm group penalty.

Techniques used: MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) in TensorFlow.

Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python
